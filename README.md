# Express / Webpack / React / Redux / Router - Starter
 
Base starting point for my React projects.

Uses WebPack and Babel 6 for bundling and building along with Hot Reloading.

Structure based on http://www.christianalfoni.com/articles/2015_04_19_The-ultimate-webpack-setup

WebPack is configured for:
- SASS
- Autoprefixing CSS back 2 versions and for IE 11



By default, the App will load the www/config.json file on start up. This external config file may be updated outside of the bundle to set configuration options for the application.
